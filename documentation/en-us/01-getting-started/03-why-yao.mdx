AI is transforming the world, especially in web development. Today, AI isn't just a luxuryâ€”it's essential. It helps create better products, make smarter decisions, and boost your business.

AI can understand language, write code, and even outperform humans in some areas, but it still requires expertise to master.

We're dedicated to making human-machine collaboration in web development easier and more efficient, which is why we created Yao.

## The Journey of Exploration

In February 2022, we launched the first public version of Yao, aiming for developers to adopt it as an innovative tool for building web applications, demonstrating that it can be used directly to create them.

By November 2022, we released an updated version of Yao, featuring a demo app that auto-generates code using another program. This demonstrated that machines can generate code, while humans can comprehend and refine it.

Fortunately, Yao was recognized by some developers, coinciding with the release of the groundbreaking GPT-3.5 model at the end of the same year. This validation confirmed we were on the right path, motivating us to continue refining Yao.

After two years of development, Yao has matured into a stable tool that seamlessly integrates human and AI collaboration, delivering an excellent development experience.

Yao offers enhanced capabilities in web development, and we are eager to see more developers using it to create web applications.

## Features

Yao is effective in both human and machine programming, with each being independent, allowing for seamless switching between the two.

### ðŸ”® AI First

We have designed a human-machine-friendly DSL (Domain-Specific Language) that makes both AI-generated and manually written code more efficient, enabling easy transitions between the two.

Typically, AI generates the initial code, and developers make modifications, significantly boosting development efficiency. In practice, AI can handle 80% to 90% of the work, allowing developers to focus on the remaining 10% to 20%.

### ðŸ”® All-in-One

Yao is an all-in-one solution for web development, requiring no additional packages or toolchain dependencies. It ships as a single executable file that includes everything you need to get started.

This greatly reduces the complexity of interacting with AI, significantly improving both the efficiency and quality of the generated code. It also eliminates many unnecessary tasks, allowing developers to focus on more important aspects.

### ðŸ”® Native TypeScript Support

Yao includes a built-in V8 engine with TypeScript support, allowing direct code execution and providing hundreds of APIs for databases, files, caching, and more, with multiple ways to add extensions.

Yao offers comprehensive programming capabilities, so you donâ€™t have to worry about being unable to implement certain features.

### ðŸ”® Multiple Coding Approaches

Combine AI-generated code, visual editing, and manual coding within the same project, with generated code that is easy to read and manually modify.

Once you understand how Yao works and its DSL, you can easily develop a code generator or AI agent tailored to your business needs.

### ðŸ”® Serverless

Launch in seconds with built-in cloud functions and API gateways to easily create server-side apps. Integrate seamlessly with the DevOps ecosystem for one-click deployment.

### ðŸ”® Edge Devices Support

Yao apps also support running on edge devices equipped with arm64 or x64 chips, suitable for various scenarios in IoT applications.
