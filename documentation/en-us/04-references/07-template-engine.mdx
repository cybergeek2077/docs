description: The detailed reference for the Yao Template Engine.

SUI Template Engine, a new feature in Yao v0.10.4, is AI-friendly and streamlines web page creation and data integration. It supports backward compatibility, enabling developers to use HTML, CSS, and TypeScript/JavaScript while promoting code reusability with a component-based architecture.

**Note:** This document is a work in progress, some links may not work as expected.

**_Note: SUI is a new feature and still experimental. For advanced frontend requirements, consider using frameworks like React or Vue. Place the built files in the `public` directory and connect them to Yao via REST API._**
