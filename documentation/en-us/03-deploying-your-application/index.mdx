It‚Äôs time to launch your application!

This section will guide you through the deployment process. You can choose to deploy your application to a server with Yao installed or run it in a Docker container.

## Overview

For self-hosted deployment, you can choose from the following options:

- üëâ [Yao Server](#yao-server): Deploy to a server with Yao installed.
- üëâ [Docker Container](#docker-container): Build a Docker image and run it in a container.

_We're planning on offering hosting services, but they're not available just yet. Once available, you'll be able to use `yao deploy` to deploy your application to our cloud service. If you're excited about hosting, let us know! We'll prioritize bringing this feature to you. ü§ù [Join us on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BkMR2NUsjU)_

## Yao Server

The Yao server is a server with Yao installed. You can deploy your application to the server and run it.

### Step 1: Install Yao

First, you need to install Yao on the server. You can follow the üëâ [Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation) to install Yao.

### Step 2: Upload Your Application

Next, you need to upload your application source code to the server.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/application
scp -r . user@server:/path/to/destination
```

**‚ùó Change the permissions of the application files:**

Keep the application files read-only and the data, db, and logs directories read-write. This is a good practice for security.

```bash
# @ Server
cd /path/to/destination
chown -R [user]:[group] . # Change the owner of the files to the user and group, e.g., webuser:webuser
chmod -R 555 .  # Set the files to read-only
chmod -R 755 data # Set the data directory to read-write
chmod -R 755 logs # Set the logs directory to read-write
chmod -R 755 db # Set the db directory to read-write
```

### Step 3: Configure Your Application

Modify the .env file on the server to configure your application. üëâ [App Configuration](../building-your-application/app-configuration#environment-variables)

Example:

```bash
YAO_ENV=production
YAO_DB_DRIVER="mysql"
YAO_DB_PRIMARY="webuser:webpass@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/website?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=True&loc=Local"
```

**üìú Tips**:

1. Prepare two env files, one for development and one for production, copy the production env file to the server and rename it to .env
2. Use `yao inspect` to check the configuration of your application. `cd /path/to/your/application && yao inspect`
3. For production use, make sure to set `YAO_ENV=production` in the .env file, It reduces the log output and improves performance.

### Step 4: Migration

The first time you deploy your application or data model changes, you need to use the `yao migrate` command to migrate the database.

`yao migrate` will detect the changes in the data model and apply them to the database. If you need to reset the database, you can use the `--reset` flag.

**‚ùóMigrate command is a dangerous operation, make sure to backup your database before running it.**

```bash
cd /path/to/your/application

# Migrate command is a dangerous operation, make sure to backup your database before running it.
yao migrate --force
```

> _Run other custom processes to prepare your application, such as seeding data, after the migration is complete, if necessary._

### Step 5: Start Your Application

After the migration is complete, you can start your application.

Use [nohup](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/nohup.1p.html) to start your application in the background.

```bash
# Start your application in the background
# ‚ùóDO NOT run this command under the root user, it should be same as the owner of the application files.
cd /path/to/your/application && nohup yao start >> /path/to/your/application/yao.log 2>&1 &
```

**‚ùóRecommended: Use PM2 or a similar process manager to manage the yao start process for improved reliability and uptime.**

```bash
# ‚ùóDO NOT run this command under the root user, it should be same as the owner of the application files.
cd /path/to/your/application

# start your application with pm2
pm2 start "yao start" --name yao-app

# Check list of running applications
pm2 list

# Check logs
pm2 logs yao-app
```

## Docker Container

You can also deploy your application in a Docker container.

### Step 1: Build Docker Image

Dockefile:

```Dockerfile
FROM yaoapp/yao:0.10.4-amd64

# Add your application files to the container
ADD /path/to/your/application /data/app

# Copy the production environment file
RUN cp /data/app/.env.online /data/app/.env

# Change the permissions of the application files:
#   /data/app Read-Only (755 should work for directories, files are 444)
#   /data/app/data Read-Write
#   /data/app/logs Read-Write
#   /data/app/db Read-Write
RUN chown -R yao:yao /data/app && \
    chmod -R 555 /data/app && \
    chmod -R 755 /data/app/data && \
    chmod -R 755 /data/app/logs && \
    chmod -R 755 /data/app/db

# Declare volumes for persistent data and logs
VOLUME /data/app/data
VOLUME /data/app/logs
VOLUME /data/app/db

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 5099

# Start the Yao application
CMD ["/usr/local/bin/yao", "start"]
```

Build and push the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t your-registry.com/your-app:version .

# Push the Docker image to your registry
docker push your-registry.com/your-app:version
```

### Step 2: Run Docker Container

```bash
# Run the Docker container
docker run -d --name your-app \
  -v /path/to/host/app/data:/data/app/data \
  -v /path/to/host/app/logs:/data/app/logs \
  -v /path/to/host/app/db:/data/app/db \
  -p 5099:5099 your-registry.com/your-app:version


# Check the running container
docker ps

# Check logs
docker logs your-app

# Some useful commands
docker exec -it your-app sh # Access the container shell
docker exec your-app sh -c "yao migrate --force" # Migrate the database
docker exec your-app sh -c "yao run [process]" # Run a custom process
```

## üéâ Congratulations

Your application is now deployed and running. üöÄ

Next, learn how to automate the deployment of your application whenever you push code to the github repository.
