Welcome to the **Yao Community**, where developers like you come together to collaborate, share ideas, and make Yao even better! 🚀

Although it has been three years since Yao’s initial release, we intentionally kept it within a niche circle before version **0.10.4**. During that time, our focus was on refining and perfecting the product. Now, we’re ready to open up and invite more developers to join the community and help shape the future of Yao.

After releasing **v0.10.4**, we launched our official **Discord channel** to create a space for discussion and feedback—come join us, share your experiences, and help grow the community!
