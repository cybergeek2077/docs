In this section, Weâ€™ll create a custom process to generate a daily report of all pets in the store, scheduled to run at 23:59 every day.

## Overview

The CLI lets you interact with your application through commands. It can be used to create custom tasks like generating reports, sending emails, and more.

To schedule commands, there are two options:

1. **Schedule Widget** - Define the schedule, specify the process, and set the execution time directly within the widget.

2. **Cron Jobs** - Use system cron jobs to run `yao run <process>` at specified times.

## Create a Process

Develop a process that generates a daily report of all pets in the store. This process will:

1. Query the database for pets created on the specified date.
2. Group them by category.
3. Save the report as a CSV file.

This example demonstrates the comprehensive programming capabilities of Yao.

```typescript
// scripts/schedules/report.ts
import { FS, Query, log } from "@yao/runtime";

/**
 * Generate a report for the given date.
 * Tests:
 *   yao run scripts.schedules.report.Generate "2024-11-25"
 *   yao run scripts.schedules.report.Generate "2024-11-18"
 * @param date The date to generate the report for. If not provided, today's date is used.
 */
function Generate(date?: string) {
  // Parse the date and get the start and end of the day
  const time = date ? new Date(date) : new Date();
  const day = `${time.getFullYear()}-${time.getMonth() + 1}-${time.getDate()}`;
  const from = `${day} 00:00:00`;
  const to = `${day} 23:59:59`;

  // Log the date range
  console.log(`Generating report for ${day}...`);
  log.Trace("Generating report for %s...", day);

  // Query data from database
  // For details, please refer to Query DSL reference
  const qb = new Query("default");
  const rows = qb.Get({
    from: "pets",
    debug: true,
    select: [
      "category_id",
      "category.category_name",
      ":COUNT(pets.id) as total",
    ],
    joins: [
      {
        left: true,
        from: "pet_categories as category",
        key: "category_id",
        foreign: "category.id",
      },
    ],
    wheres: [
      { field: "pets.created_at", ">=": from },
      { field: "pets.created_at", "<=": to },
    ],
    groups: ["category_id"],
  });

  // Save the report to a file
  // For details, please refer to Yao Runtime API reference
  const fs = new FS("data");
  const file = `/reports/${day}.csv`; // eg /data/reports/2024-11-25.csv
  const content = rows
    .map(
      (row: Record<string, any>) =>
        `${row.category_id},${row.category_name},${row.total}`
    )
    .join("\n");

  fs.WriteFile(file, content);

  console.log(`Report generated at ${file}`);
  log.Trace("Report generated at %s", file);
}
```

## Schedule via Schedule Widget

Create a new schedule widget to run the process at 23:59 every day.

```json
// schedules/report.sch.yao
{
  "name": "Generate Report at 23:59", // The name of the schedule

  // The cron expression to run the process.
  "schedule": " */1 * * * *", //  */1 * * * * for every minute, test only
  // "schedule": "0 59 23 * * *", // 23:59 every day
  "process": "scripts.schedules.report.Generate", // The process to run
  "args": [] // The arguments to pass to the process
}
```

The directory structure should look like this:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ schedules
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ report.sch.yao # Schedule Widget
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ai
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ neo.ts
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ pet.ts
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ schedules
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ report.ts # Custom Process for generating reports
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ tests.ts
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ utils.ts
```

When the HTTP server is running, scheduled tasks will execute at their specified times, and the list of schedules will be displayed in the terminal.

```bash
---------------------------------
Schedules List (1)
---------------------------------
[Schedule]  */1 * * * * report  Generate Report at 23:59      Process: scripts.schedules.report.Generate
```

## Schedule via Cron Jobs

You can also use system cron jobs to run the process at 23:59 every day.

```bash
# Open the crontab file
crontab -e

# Add the following line to the crontab file
59 23 * * * cd /path/to/your/project && yao run scripts.schedules.report.Generate

# Save and exit the crontab file
```

**Silent Mode**

if you want use yao run in shell script, you can use silent mode to avoid the output of the command.

```bash
yao run scripts.schedules.report.Generate --silent

# or
yao run -s scripts.schedules.report.Generate

```

Example:

```bash
# Run the command in silent mode
result=$(yao run scripts.schedules.report.Generate --silent)
echo $result
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations

You have successfully created a custom process to generate a daily report of all pets in the store, scheduled to run at 23:59 every day.

Next, you can integrate AI for chatbots, image generation, and enhanced user input.
