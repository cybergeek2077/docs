## Code Generation Tools

In this example, we use the GPT-4o to demonstrate AI-assisted code creation and show you how to write prompts.

However, youâ€™re free to use any other model you prefer. You can also write the code manually or create your own tools to automate code generation.

If you simply want to learn how to build the application, skip this step and copy the code from the repository into your project.

You can also use the Yao Playground as a code generation tool. It's a simple yao app that can generate code for you, and you can run it locally on your machine.
