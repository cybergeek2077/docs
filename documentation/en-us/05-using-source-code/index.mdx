This section guides you through using source code to add processes, add components, and build a custom component library tailored to your business needs.

## The Repositories

Yao is primarily developed using Golang, with the default interface engine, XGEN, built using the React framework.

It separates several repositories for different purposes:

| Repository      | Description                                                                  | Link                                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **YaoApp/Yao**  | Core Yao repository. Defines the command-line tool & internal processes.     | ðŸ‘‰ [YaoApp/yao](https://github.com/YaoApp/Yao)   |
| **YaoApp/Gou**  | App engine framework.                                                        | ðŸ‘‰ [YaoApp/gou](https://github.com/YaoApp/Gou)   |
| **YaoApp/Xun**  | Database ORM.                                                                | ðŸ‘‰ [YaoApp/xun](https://github.com/YaoApp/Xun)   |
| **YaoApp/Kun**  | Utility structures and functions.                                            | ðŸ‘‰ [YaoApp/kun](https://github.com/YaoApp/Kun)   |
| **YaoApp/Xgen** | Default UI engine for building admin panels. Integrated into Yao executable. | ðŸ‘‰ [YaoApp/Xgen](https://github.com/YaoApp/Xgen) |

Yao uses the **[rogchap/v8go](https://github.com/rogchap/v8go)** package to execute JavaScript code within the Go runtime. For our specific needs, we've forked the v8go package and added custom features to better support our requirements.

You can access the forked repository here ðŸ‘‰ [YaoApp/v8go](https://github.com/YaoApp/v8go)

## How to Use Source Code

To use the source code, you need to clone the repositories and build the binaries, build it, and run it on your local machine.
